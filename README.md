# Gerbil-Decide
A deciding wheel app I made so I didn't have to keep using a web one, made in Rust.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alokcampbell/Gerbil-Decide.git
cd gerbil-decide
```

2. Create the application:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

3. Then go into your target folder, then your release folder, and the executable will be there!
